	 * Simulates one full season of the NFL. Goes through each game and randomizes
	 * a win or loss. The method then "locks" the accompanying game for the other team
	 * (so that, for instance, if the Chargers beat the Patriots one week, the Patriots
	 * also lose to the Chargers in the context of the simulation)
	 * 
	 * Note: There is some redundancy in the fact that after the first game, 
	 * the second game gets locked, and after the second game, the program goes
	 * back and locks the first game. This does not alter the outcome, but 
	 * perhaps it is worth adding a check to see if the lock has already been done
